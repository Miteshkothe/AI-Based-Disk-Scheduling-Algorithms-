# AI-Based Disk Scheduling Algorithms

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** techniques in **disk scheduling algorithms** to improve disk access efficiency in operating systems. Traditional disk scheduling algorithms like **FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK** often face limitations in terms of seek time optimization and dynamic adaptability. By integrating AI-based approaches such as **Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Genetic Algorithms (GA)**, we aim to optimize disk scheduling for better performance.
